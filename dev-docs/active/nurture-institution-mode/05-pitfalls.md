# Pitfalls — Institution Mode

This file exists to prevent repeating mistakes within this task.

## Do-not-repeat summary

- Do not reduce institution ecology to an authorization feature; institution is the child's external growth environment.
- Do not treat institution ecology as an independent product shell; it remains inside the My-Chat scenario boundary.
- Do not put My-Chat account/auth/session semantics inside The Nurture; they belong to My-Chat.
- Do not put Nurture care ecology semantics inside My-Chat as canonical facts; family, child, institution, care group, role assignment, enrollment, grant, family-care messages, and care items belong to Nurture.
- Do not wire live manifest capabilities before Nurture care ecology schema, resolvers, policies, and handlers exist.
- Do not let institution mode drift into ranking, marketplace, competitive caregiver scoring, or institution growth tooling.
- Do not allow cross-domain ambient reads; cross-ecology movement must be `ChildLinkGrant`-gated handoff.
- Do not design only for family-side data回流; teachers and institutions must receive direct operational value.
- Do not auto-publish child photo recognition results; use reference images for candidate attribution and require teacher confirmation.
- Do not reduce institution value to generic efficiency; capture philosophy transmission, asset re-organization, and operational quality loops.
- Do not leave teachers with one UI thread per child family group; teacher-side family communication must aggregate into class inbox / attention board workflows.

## Pitfall log (append-only)

### 2026-07-03 — Treating institution mode as ordinary family-mode extension

- Symptom: The discussion starts as "托育机构是否并入面向家长的产品", which can imply adding an institution role inside a family-owned workspace.
- Context: Institution workflows are one organization to many caregivers and children, closer to My-Chat's education-domain organization topology than to a single-family workspace.
- What we tried: Reframed as "same scenario, second tenancy mode" rather than a family-mode subfeature.
- Why it failed (or current hypothesis): A simple role addition would blur ownership and privacy boundaries.
- Fix / workaround: Model institution mode on `organization` workspace, with My-Chat-owned care canonical objects and The Nurture-owned projections/workflows.
- Superseded 2026-07-05: The ownership part of this workaround is superseded. Current rule: My-Chat owns account identity and scenario shell; Nurture owns the care ecology graph, including role assignments, child care process, enrollment, grant, family-care messages, and care items.
- Prevention: Start every institution-mode design review from `02-architecture.md` sections 1-4 and confirm ownership before fields or UI.

### 2026-07-03 — Reducing institution ecology to a consent bridge

- Symptom: The design over-centers `ChildLinkGrant`, making the institution look like an authorization extension of family mode.
- Context: The institution is a real external environment in the child's growth process. It has its own organization, teachers, group rhythms, workflows, and operational incentives.
- What we tried: Reframed `ChildLinkGrant` as the cross-ecology data-flow mechanism only.
- Why it failed (or current hypothesis): If the product does not help institutions and teachers directly, they have no reason to adopt it.
- Fix / workaround: Add an explicit institution/teacher value model before capabilities: record reduction, group care operations, parent need intake, handoff, and quality review.
- Prevention: Before designing a capability, state which institution/teacher pain it solves and how it helps the child.
- References: `02-architecture.md` section 5, `03-implementation-notes.md` D-004.

### 2026-07-04 — Treating face recognition as direct publication

- Symptom: "自动归类" could be misread as automatically publishing every recognized photo into family-visible child albums.
- Context: The intended flow is based on system-held child reference images such as attendance cards, not a general public face-recognition product. Class group photos are institution/class assets first.
- What we tried: Split media into original class asset, child album view, and family-visible view.
- Why it failed (or current hypothesis): Direct publication would amplify false positives and child privacy exposure.
- Fix / workaround: Use recognition only to create candidate child attribution; require teacher confirmation and policy checks before child/family views.
- Prevention: Every media attribution design must state asset owner, derived views, confirmation gate, and exposure policy.
- References: `02-architecture.md` section 5.2, `03-implementation-notes.md` D-005.

### 2026-07-05 — Over-correcting ownership into My-Chat

- Symptom: The architecture says My-Chat owns care canonical objects, `ChildLinkGrant`, family/child/institution identity, and Nurture only keeps projections.
- Context: My-Chat is the ecosystem frame and single account system. Each scenario currently maintains its own multi-user business relationships. In Nurture, parents, teachers, and institution managers are My-Chat users, but their Nurture roles and relationships are scenario-owned; children are not My-Chat users.
- What we tried: Treat My-Chat education-domain organization/class/student tables as the direct ownership template for Nurture care canonical.
- Why it failed (or current hypothesis): That pushes Nurture-specific family, child, institution, class, enrollment, consent, and care communication semantics into the generic account/shell layer.
- Fix / workaround: Define `NurtureChildCareProcess` as the center; store Nurture participants, role assignments, enrollment, `NurtureChildLinkGrant`, family-care threads/messages/items, and care facts as Nurture canonical data. My-Chat only owns account identity, shell/runtime, notification, and deep-link surfaces.
- Prevention: Before designing tables or handoffs, separate "who can log in" (`my_chat.user`) from "what role and relationship this user has in Nurture" (`NurtureParticipant` + role assignment).
- References: `02-architecture.md` sections 1-4, `03-implementation-notes.md` D-007 through D-010.

### 2026-07-05 — Modeling family_to_org as a generic note instead of teacher workload

- Symptom: `family_to_org` is framed as a small parent note or care constraint field, but does not solve the teacher's actual pain of switching across many child-specific family groups.
- Context: A class with 10 children creates 10 private family-care threads. Privacy requires those threads to remain separate for families, but teachers need one class-level work surface.
- What we tried: Model the minimum data classes as `care_constraint` and `care_day_note`.
- Why it failed (or current hypothesis): It captures data transfer but not operational load. Teachers still need to triage, confirm, reply, and follow up across many threads.
- Fix / workaround: Add `class_family_inbox` as the first family_to_org capability. Store raw messages as `NurtureFamilyCareMessage`, extract structured `NurtureFamilyCareItem`, and render a class-level inbox/attention board for teachers.
- Prevention: Every `family_to_org` design must state how it appears in the teacher's class workflow, not only what data class crosses the boundary.
